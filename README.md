# Welcome to the Official GitHub of [Murtaza Qazi] 

## About Me 🧑‍💻

Hey there! I'm Murtaza, your friendly neighborhood 17-year-old coding shithole and 3D modeling enthusiast. I've been creating magic with code since I was 12—yeah, I started early. I also dabble in 3D modeling, which i sometimes suck at

Founder and CEO of **Racemfd**, a company that... well, let's just say it's as ambitious as I am. So, yeah, I run my own thing while also juggling school, projects, and attempting to keep my sleep schedule under control (spoiler: it's not working).

## Skills ⚡

- **Programming Languages:** Python, JavaScript, C++, and more. If you name it, I've probably tried it... and probably broke something in the process. 😅
- **3D Modeling:** Blender wizardry. I can turn a cube into a dragon faster than you can say "rendering time."
- **Game Development:** Unity and Unreal Engine—because why just code when you can create entire worlds?
- **Web Development:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript... basically, I make the internet look less like a mess.

## Tech Stack 🛠️

- **Languages:**  
  - JavaScript (obviously), Python, C++, TypeScript, HTML/CSS, SQL
- **Back-End:**  
  - Node.js, Express.js, NestJS (you name it, I build it!)
- **Front-End:**  
  - React, Vue.js, Svelte (yeah, I'm a front-end wizard too)
- **Databases:**  
  - MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Firebase (sometimes I feel like a database whisperer)
- **3D Modeling:**  
  - Blender, Autodesk Maya, ZBrush
- **Game Development:**  
  - Unity, Unreal Engine, Godot (basically all the game engines that sound cool)
- **DevOps/Tools:**  
  - Docker, Git, GitHub Actions, AWS, Firebase Hosting, Netlify, Vercel
- **Testing & Automation:**  
  - Jest, Mocha, Cypress, Selenium (because who has time for manual testing?)
- **Others:**  
  - GraphQL, REST APIs, WebSockets (I can talk to your app in real-time)

## My Company: Racemfd 💼

You might be wondering, "What is Racemfd?" Well, it's my company, and it's a bit of everything: coding, 3D modeling, game dev, and possibly an entire future empire. But for now, it’s just me, a laptop, and a couple of questionable late-night decisions.

### What Do We Do? 🤔

- **Tech Solutions:** If it involves code, we probably do it. Need an app? I can help with that.
- **3D Models:** From characters to environments, I can make your 3D dreams come true (or nightmares if you're into that). 
- **Creative Projects:** From game prototypes to simulations, I’m always working on something interesting, like creating a flying car (I'm kidding... or am I?).

## Projects 🔧

- **[RaceMFD]:** A shadow project born from obsession. Racemfd monitors tire temps, fuel levels, brake heat—every pulse of the machine, feeding data in real time. It’s beta; it’s ruthless; why did i make it? because passion is one hell of a drug
- **[Miles System]:** A Discord-based mileage tracking system—built on a Node.js backend with Firestore storage and an admin dashboard—that lets you accrue and redeem points just like an airline loyalty program.

## Fun Facts About Me 🎉

- I’ve been coding longer than I’ve been able to legally drive a car. So you can imagine how much I’ve perfected the art of procrastination.
- I once spent 12 hours straight modeling a chair in Blender. Did I need that chair? Absolutely not.
- My dream job is probably something that doesn’t exist yet, but I'll get there.

## Let's Connect! 🚀

If you want to chat about tech, 3D models, or the best pizza toppings, feel free to reach out. I'm always up for collaborations or just some good old-fashioned coding banter.

Oh, and if you’re here because you think I’m the next Elon Musk—no pressure, but I’m currently working on it.
