# Welcome to the Official GitHub of Murtaza Qazi

## About Me 🧑‍💻

Hey there! I'm Murtaza, your friendly neighborhood 17-year-old coding shithole and 3D modeling enthusiast. I've been creating magic with code since I was 12—yeah, I started early. I also dabble in 3D modeling, which i sometimes suck at

Founder and CEO of **Racemfd**, a company that... well, let's just say it's as ambitious as I am. So, yeah, I run my own thing while also juggling school, projects, and attempting to keep my sleep schedule under control (spoiler: it's not working).

## Skills ⚡

- **Programming Languages:** LuaU, JavaScript, C++, and more. If you name it, I've probably tried it... and probably broke something in the process. 😅
- **3D Modeling:** Blender wizardry. I can turn a cube into a dragon faster than you can say "rendering time."
- **Web Development:**JavaScript, Node.JS, express ... basically, I make the internet look less like a mess.

## Tech Stack 🛠️

- **Languages:**  
  - JavaScript (obviously), LuaU, HTML/CSS, SQL
- **Back-End:**  
  - Node.js, Express.js,  (you name it, I build it!)
- **Databases:**  
  - MongoDB, FireStore, Firebase (sometimes I feel like a database whisperer)
- **3D Modeling:**  
  - Blender, Substance Painter
- **Game Development:**  
  - Roblox
- **DevOps/Tools:**  
  - Docker, Git, GitHub Actions, AWS, Firebase Hosting, Netlify, Vercel
- **Others:**  
  - GraphQL, REST APIs, WebSockets (I can talk to your app in real-time)

## My Company: Racemfd 💼

You might be wondering, "What is Racemfd?" Well, it's my company, and i fucking love it


## Projects 🔧

- **[RaceMFD]:** A shadow project born from obsession. Racemfd monitors tire temps, fuel levels, brake heat—every pulse of the machine, feeding data in real time. It’s beta; it’s ruthless; why did i make it? because passion is one hell of a drug
- **[Miles System]:** A Discord-based mileage tracking system—built on a Node.js backend with Firestore storage and an admin dashboard—that lets you accrue and redeem points just like an airline loyalty program.

## Fun Facts About Me 🎉

- I’ve been coding longer than I’ve been able to legally drive a car. So you can imagine how much I’ve perfected the art of procrastination.
- I once spent 12 hours straight modeling a chair in Blender. Did I need that chair? Absolutely not.
- My dream job is probably something that doesn’t exist yet, but I'll get there.
