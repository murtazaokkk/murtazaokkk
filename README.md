## About Me 🧑‍💻

Hey there! I'm Murtaza Qazi, your friendly neighborhood 17-year-old coding prodigy and 3D modeling enthusiast. I've been creating magic with code since I was 12—yeah, I started early. I also dabble in 3D modeling, which is basically like giving the digital world a makeover, one polygon at a time.

Founder and CEO of **Racemfd**, a company that... well, let's just say it's as ambitious as I am. So, yeah, I run my own thing while also juggling school, projects, and attempting to keep my sleep schedule under control (spoiler: it's not working).

## Skills ⚡

- **Programming Languages:** Python, JavaScript, C++, and more. If you name it, I've probably tried it... and probably broke something in the process. 😅
- **3D Modeling:** Blender wizardry. I can turn a cube into a dragon faster than you can say "rendering time."
- **Web Development:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript... basically, I make the internet look less like a mess.
